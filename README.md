# Testing Debounce 

This is a repository that demonstrates on how we can test the code that has `debounce` inside of it in a clean way. 

`debounce` helps delay the time when the value gets fired and is mostly useful when it comes down to observing text being input inside a text field. If you are willing to test the behavior, you would have to add timers to make sure that test passes. However, this makes testing harder and slower as time it would take for a single test would make entire test suite slow.
